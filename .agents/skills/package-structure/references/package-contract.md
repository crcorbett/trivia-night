# Package contract

## Ownership before files

Name the capability, its callers, its untrusted boundaries, its runtime owner,
and why an existing package cannot own it. A package is justified by a stable
semantic boundary, not by file count.

Compiled packages use `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json`, relative internal imports,
and explicit exports. Root exports are absent by default; an intentional root
must remain contract-only. The source condition maps to `src`, `types` to
declarations, and `default` to `dist`. `publishConfig.exports` omits the source
condition. Source-only packages point both development/default resolution at
source and explain the bundler requirement in their package README.

Required Effect service paths:

```text
src/schemas.ts
src/errors.ts
src/service.ts
src/live.layer.ts
src/test.layer.ts
src/__testing__/fixtures.ts
src/__testing__/observations.ts
test/service.test.ts
```

Use `mock.layer.ts` only when its semantics are distinct from the deterministic
test Layer. Tests live under `test/`; `src/__testing__` contains reusable setup,
fixtures, and observations only.

Each package README names the semantic owner, public/live/test export paths,
downstream architecture/proof impact, runbook applicability, and explicit
non-claims. Repository profiles—not this global contract—name exact local
commands and document paths.

## Export proof

Consumer fixtures must prove all four modes:

1. repository source condition resolves source;
2. TypeScript resolves emitted declarations;
3. default resolution uses built JavaScript;
4. packed/publish exports omit source-only paths and conditions.

Never rely only on checking that export keys exist.

`publishConfig.exports` is not a portable manifest rewrite: npm and Bun pack may
retain the development `exports` map, while other package managers may apply the
publish map. A publishable package therefore needs the repository's explicit
staged-manifest/prepack path and tarball inspection. Prove the actual publisher
used by that repository; do not infer a clean tarball from `publishConfig`.
