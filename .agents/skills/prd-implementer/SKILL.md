description: Implement an approved product or technical SPEC and its task list in small, verified, sequential slices. Use when executing repository plans that require Effect/TypeScript architecture, React composition, external SDK boundaries, documentation and README synchronization, lint and CI enforcement, repository-skill updates, or evidence-backed reconciliation of the SPEC and tasks as implementation discoveries arise.

# PRD Implementer

Implement the canonical SPEC as a sequence of accepted end-to-end slices. Keep code, documentation, enforcement, and planning artifacts synchronized.

## Start from current truth

1. Read applicable `AGENTS.md`, the exact SPEC, its sibling task list, active execution plan, relevant docs and READMEs, current worktree, installed dependency versions, package scripts, lint/test/CI configuration, and representative code.
2. Preserve unrelated changes. Confirm task dependencies and current completion evidence before editing.
3. Use DeepWiki through Executor MCP only for upstream libraries. Verify any guidance against the installed version and local types; never use DeepWiki as a substitute for reading the checkout.

Load context in layers: external systems own live external state, repository
docs own durable repository truth, and the active SPEC/tasks own the current
change. Pull current and affected owners just in time; link to history, raw
proof, and provider truth instead of copying them into the active context.

For substantial repository, operational, automation, migration, or harness
work, read the sibling
[`repository-harness-contract`](../docs-maintainer/references/repository-harness-contract.md)
once during grounding, including its contract map and invariant register. Apply
the stable invariant IDs through the owning task surfaces rather than copying
the references into the SPEC, code, or final report.

## Suggest one implementation goal

When an approved SPEC has multiple implementation tasks and no active goal,
suggest creating one goal for implementing the whole SPEC to verified
completion. Present the proposed objective in user-facing language and create
the goal only after the user explicitly requests or confirms it.

Use the SPEC's accepted tasks as sequential milestones inside that one goal;
do not create a separate goal for every task. Continue an existing matching
goal instead of replacing it. Keep the goal active until all accepted tasks,
documentation reconciliation, terminal review, and closeout verification are
complete. Goal state coordinates persistence across turns; it never replaces
the canonical task ledger, acceptance evidence, or proof receipts.

## Delegated Slice Prompt Contract

Keep one primary trajectory accountable for integration, proof, delivery, and
closeout. Delegate a bounded task only when it has an independently provable
boundary, benefits from fresh/adversarial evidence, or the task artifact proves
disjoint writes. Review delegated work and return an incomplete slice to the
same agent before acceptance. Do not use one-subagent-per-task or a fixed number
of audit passes as acceptance proof. Parallelize only when dependencies and
write scopes are explicitly disjoint.

Every delegated slice states the accepted outcome, exact target revision and
paths, applicable repository instructions, authority and stop conditions,
document/runbook/proof impact, commands or procedure owners, required receipt,
limitations, non-claims, and return-to-owner condition. The primary trajectory
reviews the evidence and owns merge, cross-surface reconciliation, rollback,
and task closure.

## Execute sequentially

For each task:

1. Re-state its owning paths, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and verification.
2. When work derives from an audit, confirm the task's accepted finding IDs.
   Validate the structured crosswalk when the repository provides its audit
   validator. Do not implement rejected, deferred, or optional findings without
   explicit acceptance.
3. For a material slice, load the sibling
   [`docs-maintainer`](../docs-maintainer/SKILL.md) and its local profile when
   present; establish the slice's documentation-impact rows.
4. Implement the smallest complete vertical slice.
5. Update the SPEC, tasks, diagrams, owning docs, necessary pointers, READMEs,
   lint/configuration, skills, and operational artifacts immediately when
   implementation evidence changes them.
6. Audit the diff for architecture, helper sprawl, boundary provenance, React composition, and enforcement.
7. Replay the task's requirement-to-proof crosswalk against the actual
   assertions. For every material requirement, confirm the direct observable,
   expected postcondition, plausible false green rejected, focused command or
   procedure owner, evidence owner, receipt path, limitations, and non-claims.
   Reject proof by proxy from broad suite coverage, successful construction,
   source layout, or a neighbouring assertion.
8. Run the narrow proof first and broaden according to blast radius.
9. Record evidence and mark completion only when every required surface and
   documentation-impact row passes.

Do not preserve a fixed number of passes, subagents, files, or commands as a
process goal. Risk, dependencies, accepted outcomes, and evidence determine the
slice and verification depth.

## Effect implementation bar

- Use the repository's installed Effect APIs and established Service/Context and Layer style.
- Keep primary operations lazy, flat, readable, and sequential with `Effect.gen`, meaningful `Effect.fn`, or the local equivalent. Use combinators where they improve local composition.
- Keep one-use transformations and typed error handling inline. Extract only reused domain policy, independently testable behavior, or a real I/O boundary.
- Reuse canonical Schemas, schema-derived types, branded IDs, services, Layers, tagged errors, and constructors. Do not mirror DTOs or redeclare identifiers as raw strings.
- Decode unknown values once at the real boundary and encode values at outward transport boundaries.
- Use Schema-backed `Config`/`ConfigProvider` configuration and preserve redaction until immediate SDK construction.
- Keep expected failures typed; do not use `instanceof` for policy or provider-error classification.
- Keep Effects lazy until the repository's application/runtime boundary. Do not scatter `runPromise`, nested runtimes, ad hoc `try/catch`, or Promise islands.

For an external SDK, invoke the `effect-client-wrapper` contract. Reject generic `use` callbacks, exposed raw clients, raw `id: string`, primitive config, `instanceof`, and unchecked provider output. Require named operations, encoded requests, immediate output decoding, typed Schema errors, operation-specific retry policy, and live plus mock/test Layers.

## React implementation bar

- Compose data loading, shared state, and Effect execution at the route or feature boundary.
- Keep leaf components focused on rendering and local interaction through narrow readonly props and callbacks.
- Colocate one-use components; extract shared components or hooks only for demonstrated reuse or a stable semantic boundary.
- Cover semantic HTML, keyboard and focus behavior, loading, empty, error, disabled, and responsive states.
- Reject synchronization Effects, duplicated state, service-aware leaves, giant route components, boolean-prop matrices, and hooks that merely rename one call.

## Reconcile every surface

Before accepting a task, resolve every SPEC impact-ledger row for docs, READMEs, lint/custom rules and fixtures, CI, skills and agent instructions, configuration/manifests, Schemas/migrations/generators, tests/fixtures, observability, release, rollout, and rollback. A required surface cannot be deferred with a vague follow-up.

Use only commands that exist in the repository. Validate changed skills with the available skill validator. Distinguish pre-existing failures from regressions, and finish with changed paths, commands and outcomes, updated task status, and residual risks.

For material tasks, also reconcile the complete harness contract:

- respect truth layers and semantic owners; update the earliest durable owner
  and remove weaker duplicated reminders;
- keep skills as judgment/routing and runbooks as procedures with preconditions,
  authority, exact steps, bounded evidence, rollback, and escalation;
- emit bounded receipts with invariant, target, recovery, omitted-detail path,
  postcondition, artifact identity, limitations, and non-claims;
- match proof to the actual artifact, environment, boundary, and small
  consumer-visible critical journeys with an oracle against imitation;
- distinguish capability, authenticated identity, authority, and approval, and
  record revocation, duration, audit receipt, rollback, and escalation for
  consequential operations;
- admit automation only when signal, durable state, authority,
  idempotence/convergence, per-run proof, bounded failure, stopping, and
  escalation are settled;
- preserve the worker/host/tool/runtime/skill epoch and the four distinct
  clocks when evaluation claims depend on them; and
- retain failed, blocked, deferred, superseded, inconclusive, and no-op evidence
  with provenance, successor/tombstone, recovery, and explicit non-claims
  outside the default context route.

The docs-maintainer method and local profile own the local document map, exact
checks, archive and mirror rules, runbooks, and exceptions; this skill must not
invent them. Update owning docs and necessary pointers inside the
implementation slice. Mark every impact-ledger surface `Change required`,
`Preserve`, or `N/A` with evidence and attach its bounded receipt before task
acceptance.

For compound runtime or provider policy, inspect each property as well as the
terminal result. Retry tests distinguish eligible and ineligible failures,
bounded attempts, backoff, jitter, idempotent reads, uncertain writes, and
observation after timeout when applicable. Isolation, substitution, and
composition-root tests directly assert the semantic result from every relevant
root.

## Close out the SPEC

Invoke docs-maintainer again before final task or SPEC closeout. Reconcile the
active SPEC, tasks, execution plan, lifecycle state, successor/tombstone and
archive pointers, proof packets, limitations, and non-claims against the
implemented repository. Run the exact local documentation and lifecycle checks
and mark completion only after current owners and planning artifacts agree.

When review or a terminal audit finds a gap, reopen the owning task. The
correction invalidates affected downstream acceptance, receipts, rollback
identity, and earlier terminal-audit status. Rerun focused proof and the
affected review lens. A SPEC-required terminal audit runs once after every
implementation task is terminal, followed by full verification on the exact
receipt-bearing state; it does not run after each slice.

For ordinary repository improvements, finish after the accepted important
corrections, normal repository checks, applicable real journeys, and one fresh
independent review. Preserve optional work as optional. Do not extend execution
into a comparative harness campaign unless that distinct claim and authority
were approved.
