description: Audit and edit repository documentation so material code, configuration, API, infrastructure, CI, operational, skill, and SPEC changes update the correct semantic owners in the same implementation slice. Use for documentation maintenance, docs audits, stale or contradictory READMEs, documentation-impact assessment during implementation, and PRD writing/review/closeout. Preserve just-in-time context, distinguish skills from runbooks and durable docs from dated proof, and provide claim-matched verification. Do not use for public copywriting alone or to copy mutable provider state into repository docs.

# Documentation Maintainer

Keep documentation aligned with repository behavior by updating the earliest
durable semantic owner and only the pointers that must lead to it.

## Establish the local contract

1. Read applicable `AGENTS.md`, inspect the worktree, and identify the exact
   change, repository, environment, and write authority. Do not infer authority
   to mutate providers, publish, release, or push from permission to edit docs.
2. Read the repository-local `docs-maintainer` profile completely when one is
   present at `references/repository-profile.md`. It owns repository paths,
   commands, generated-document boundaries, mirrors, exceptions, and archive
   policy. The global skill supplies method, never local truth.
3. If no local profile exists, derive a temporary impact map from the root
   `README*`, `docs/README*`, applicable package/app READMEs, active SPEC/tasks,
   configuration, and changed implementation. Record missing ownership as a
   gap; do not invent canonical paths or command names.
4. Select an execution mode:
   - **attached change:** when the user authorized implementation and repository
     edits, edit affected documentation and task artifacts in the same slice;
   - **audit or curator:** for scheduled/background freshness work, or when
     mutation authority is absent, produce an isolated report-only candidate
     with provenance and a proposed patch. Publication requires a separately
     named responsible owner and publisher identity.

Never let a curator publish its own uncorroborated findings or treat its prior
output as independent feedback. Pin any published context projection to an
immutable repository revision; refresh it only at a recorded phase boundary.

Keep these truth layers distinct and apply the strongest applicable precedence:
external system for current external state; shared store for shared source
material; immutable context projection for a recorded phase; repository code,
config, and Schemas for desired state; durable docs for explanation and routing;
dated evidence for observations; active SPEC/tasks for current intent and
execution. Link across layers instead of copying claims between them.

For a repository-wide documentation audit, substantial PRD, or cross-cutting
harness change, read
[repository-harness-contract.md](references/repository-harness-contract.md).
It routes to the complete local method and requires no external source lookup.
Load the applicable structured modules directly:

- [contract map](references/harness/contract-map.md) for mode and lifecycle;
- [invariant register](references/harness/invariant-register.md) for stable IDs;
- [context and ownership](references/harness/context-and-ownership.md) for truth
  layers, phased retrieval, and publication boundaries;
- [proof and evaluation](references/harness/proof-and-evaluation.md) for
  journeys, delivery, receipts, terminal states, and proportional evaluation;
- [operations and authority](references/harness/operations-and-authority.md)
  when runbooks, providers, controls, releases, or automation are in scope; and
- [repository variation](references/harness/repository-variation.md) when
  creating or changing the local profile.

Use the Schemas and templates under `assets/harness/` for repository profiles,
critical journeys, bounded receipts, authority envelopes, and feedback or
automation controls. Do not replace those fixed field contracts with free-form
prose.
For an ordinary localized documentation change, do not load that broader
contract unless an ownership, delivery, dependency, or proof question requires
it. This skill owns the documentation track; use the sibling `repo-structure`
skill for a complete repository audit.

## Load context in phases

Use just enough context to decide and then prove the change:

1. **Ground:** read the change, directly affected docs/READMEs, the docs router,
   the owning architecture or standard, and active task context.
2. **Investigate:** inspect code, config, generated owners, history, provider
   readback, or upstream material only to resolve an identified question.
3. **Land:** inventory all affected docs, READMEs, skills, runbooks, references,
   generated artifacts, indexes, and active/archive pointers. Reconcile every
   contradiction on an affected route before closeout.

Do not preload the whole repository for an ordinary localized change. A
repository-wide documentation audit or PRD review may require a full
`docs/**` and `README*` accounting under its owning skill.

For a repository-wide audit, return documentation findings in the stable
finding format owned by the repository-audit procedure: consequence,
evidence, semantic owner, root correction, duplicated guidance to retire,
affected surfaces, proof, authority, limitations, and non-claims. Separate
important corrections from optional improvements.

## Build the impact ledger

Read [document-classes.md](references/document-classes.md) to select semantic
owners and [change-impact.md](references/change-impact.md) for the trigger
matrix. For each surface, record `Change required`, `Preserve`, or `N/A`, with:

- changed behavior or claim;
- semantic owner and required pointers;
- exact affected path or narrowly bounded path set;
- lifecycle transition, if any;
- generated source and regeneration command, if applicable;
- verification and observable postcondition;
- proof location and explicit non-claims.

Cover docs, root/package/app READMEs, architecture/ADRs, standards, API and
generated references, runbooks, critical journeys, proof/evidence, skills and
agent instructions, lint/config/CI docs, migration/release notes, and active
SPEC/tasks. Never accept a generic “update docs” item.

## Edit the correct owner

- Put durable design, invariants, and boundaries in architecture or standards.
- Put exact repeatable operations in target-owned runbooks, including
  preconditions, authority, sequential steps, receipts, rollback, and
  escalation. Skills teach selection and judgment; they must route to rather
  than copy runbooks.
- Treat a procedure found in architecture or a README as an ownership defect,
  not precedent to extend. Propose or create the target-owned runbook and leave
  only durable rationale plus a pointer at the old location.
- Put public setup and entry-point navigation in READMEs. Keep them short and
  link to deeper owners.
- Keep root `AGENTS.md` as a terse map of repository purpose/compatibility,
  common operating loop, a small set of task classes or golden paths, and links
  to their context, commands, and proof. Do not append completed-feature
  histories or per-change atlas entries.
- Put mutable external state and one-run observations in dated, addressable
  evidence. Never present a provider response, deployment ID, secret age, or
  current revision as durable repository truth.
- Edit the source of generated documentation, run its real generator, and do
  not hand-edit output unless repository policy explicitly says it is owned.
- Update active SPEC/tasks and their evidence when implementation changes a
  requirement, decision, dependency, or acceptance claim.
- Use successor/tombstone links for replaced current docs. Preserve failed and
  historical evidence with provenance outside default navigation.
- Retire weaker duplicated reminders after promoting a repeated finding to its
  earliest enforceable owner: schema, type, lint rule, test, generator,
  runbook, or canonical document.
- In curator mode, record source, provenance, freshness, classification,
  audience, attached evidence, proposed semantic owner, target revision, and
  unresolved contradictions. Keep candidate material outside the worker's
  retrieval path until a responsible reviewer accepts it and a separately
  identified publisher performs an atomic publication with readback.

A curator result is incomplete unless it returns an explicit `candidate` block
with every field above plus responsible reviewer, publisher identity,
publication status, revocation/quarantine, last-known-good recovery, and
post-publication readback. Use `unknown` with a named owner/resume trigger when
evidence cannot supply a field; never silently omit it.

## Keep implementation and documentation honest

- Confirm claims against current code, config, and runtime evidence at the
  boundary they describe. Treat tool output as observed data, not policy or
  authority.
- Keep boundary encoding/decoding, Effect service ownership, error contracts,
  client wrappers, React composition, commands, and public API examples aligned
  with the repository's installed versions and enforced patterns.
- Update owning docs during each implementation slice, before the slice can be
  accepted. Do not defer accumulated documentation work to a final sweep.
- Record unresolved product or authority decisions as blockers in active task
  context instead of silently choosing them.
- When a change adds or revises a critical journey, retain a stable journey ID,
  procedure owner, observable oracle against plausible imitation, environment,
  and receipt route rather than expanding the inventory into every test.
- When review or a terminal audit finds an issue, record why the prior SPEC,
  task, implementation check, or receipt allowed the false green. Promote the
  prevention to the earliest durable owner: domain contract, direct test
  oracle, task verification, lint/tooling control, or lifecycle rule. Retain
  the dated finding as evidence rather than adding another audit reminder.
- Any correction after task acceptance reopens the owning task and refreshes
  affected proof, candidate identity, rollback identity, and lifecycle
  receipts. A terminal audit runs only after the complete SPEC is terminal;
  later implementation invalidates its terminal status.

## Verify the claim

Read [proof-authority-and-lifecycle.md](references/proof-authority-and-lifecycle.md).
Run the exact local documentation, link, generated-artifact, lint, typecheck,
test, build, journey, skill, and mirror checks required by the impact ledger.
Do not invent commands. Distinguish pre-existing failures from regressions.
Never fabricate an artifact identity, path, edit, command, exit status, or
executed check. When no checkout or repository-local owner map is available,
return only class-level proposed owners with status `unverified`; do not report
an attached edit or accepted outcome.

Return a bounded receipt containing:

1. outcome and changed semantic owners;
2. impact-ledger rows, including explicit `N/A` decisions;
3. exact checks and postconditions;
4. artifact, environment, actor/authority, and critical journeys where relevant;
5. limitations and claims not established;
6. failed, no-op, or inconclusive evidence path, last successful step, observed
   state, escalation, resume trigger, smallest unresolved choice, rollback, and
   next owner when not accepted.

Keep full logs in an addressable artifact and show only the violated invariant,
exact target, recovery hint, omitted-detail path, and postcondition in the
default context.

## Stop conditions

Stop and surface the gap when:

- no current semantic owner can be identified;
- current docs conflict and evidence cannot resolve which one owns the claim;
- a generated owner or real verification command is unknown;
- the requested claim requires provider, release, publication, or mutation
  authority that has not been granted;
- required proof would cross an unapproved environment or reveal secrets;
- a runbook lacks rollback or escalation for a consequential operation.
