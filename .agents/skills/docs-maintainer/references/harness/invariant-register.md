# Harness invariant register

Use these IDs in audits, SPECs, tasks, controls, and receipts. A repository may
mark an invariant not applicable with evidence; it may not silently redefine
one.

| ID                  | Invariant                                                                                                                            | Required evidence                                                                                  | Typical failure                                         |

| `HC-REPO-001`       | The repository teaches one coherent continuation.                                                                                    | Accepted pattern in code, types, tests, examples, and enforcement                                  | Old and new patterns remain equally plausible           |
| `HC-BOUNDARY-001`   | Untrusted values decode once at ingress and encode at outward boundaries.                                                            | Owning Schema, adapter, tests                                                                      | Raw primitives or unchecked SDK output flow inward      |

| `HC-DOC-001`        | Architecture, standards, READMEs, skills, runbooks, proof, plans, and archives own distinct claims.                                  | Document classification and route checks                                                           | Skill copies a runbook or proof becomes policy          |
| `HC-PROOF-001`      | Every material requirement has direct proof matching the artifact, boundary, environment, journey, and claim.                        | Requirement-to-proof crosswalk, bounded receipt, direct oracle, and plausible false green rejected | Broad suite or neighbouring assertion claimed as proof  |
| `HC-AUTH-001`       | Capability, identity, authority, approval, and external actuality remain separate.                                                   | Authority envelope, approval receipt, readback                                                     | Tool access treated as permission to mutate             |
| `HC-FEEDBACK-001`   | Repeated findings improve the earliest durable owner and retire weaker reminders.                                                    | Control record, fixture, retirement target                                                         | More prose added after every recurrence                 |
| `HC-AUTO-001`       | Continuous work is admitted only for a settled, observable, bounded, recoverable loop.                                               | Control record with signal, state, convergence, proof, stop, rollback, escalation                  | Exploratory judgment automated                          |
| `HC-DEPENDENCY-001` | Material dependencies and replacements have capability, trust, upgrade, incident, removal, and lifetime owners.                      | Dependency decision and compatibility proof                                                        | Local replacement silently inherits unowned obligations |
| `HC-EPOCH-001`      | Claims about worker or harness effectiveness are bound to model, host, tools, runtime, skills, target, authority, and context epoch. | Epoch identity and comparable scenario                                                             | Old qualification applied to a changed worker           |

| `HC-EVIDENCE-001`   | Failed, blocked, deferred, superseded, no-op, and inconclusive work remains identifiable outside the default route.                  | Provenance, receipt, successor or resume trigger, non-claims                                       | Raw experiments deleted or preloaded forever            |

## Repository engineering invariants

Apply these where TypeScript, Effect, external clients, packages, or React are
in scope:

- keep Effects lazy, flat, sequential, composable, and executed at application
  boundaries;
- reuse Schema-derived types, branded identities, tagged errors, Config,
  services, and Layers;
- forbid raw-client escape hatches, generic SDK callbacks, `instanceof` policy,
  primitive semantic config, raw semantic identifiers, and unchecked output;
- keep one-use transformations inline and reject helper, wrapper, hook, and
  module sprawl without semantic weight and a real reuse or substitution point;
- separate schema/type/service contracts, live Layers, test Layers, and testing
  support through explicit package exports; and
- keep data loading, Effect execution, remote commands, and orchestration at
  route or feature boundaries while presentation leaves receive narrow readonly
  values and callbacks.
